        <p class="paragraph-5">    Dr. Rife grew up in Tomball, Texas and attended Rosehill Christian and Tomball high
          schools. After completing a BS at Texas A&amp;M she was admitted to UTMB at Galveston for medical school. Her
          pediatric residency was back at a Texas A&amp;M program at Scott &amp; White in Temple, Texas. <br></p>
        <p class="paragraph-5">    When training was completed, Dr. Rife returned home to work with a local clinic for 7
          years. Even with a great job, there were things in the medical system that got in the way of patient care. The
          insurance companies were running the show. Dr. Rife has decided the best way to offer real care to patients is
          to run her own show and Rife Pediatrics began in 2020.<br></p>
        <p class="paragraph-5">     About the same time Dr. Rife and her family felt called to move to a farm in East
          Texas. Her husband is working hard to run a pasture raised meat chicken and beef production farm. Since Dr.
          Rife is living in East Texas, the practice has become a telemedicine clinic. Dr. Rife travels back to Tomball
          for a few days EVERY month to see patients and keep in touch with family in the area.<br></p>
        <p class="paragraph-5">    With so many families in the Tomball area that Dr. Rife wants to continue to care for
          and help, she feels blessed to have this opportunity to provide real medical care for your children. Dr. Rife
          stays busy homeschooling 4 of her children while chasing her toddler around and helping on the farm. God has
          generously provided his guidance every step of the way. To God be the glory!<br></p>

        <p class="paragraph-3">    Dr. Daniel Kohl was born and raised in Cedarville, a small college town in Ohio. He
          became interested in medicine while on several medical-mission trips to Philadelphia, India, Nepal, and
          Paraguay. He eagerly pursued a pre-medical education at Cedarville University, including minors in Bible and
          Spanish. In 2016, Dr. Kohl earned his Bachelor of Science degree in molecular and cellular biology with
          highest honor.<br><br>    At Ohio University Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine, Dr. Kohl learned a
          holistic approach to primary care. He served students and the community as president of the campus Christian
          Medical and Dental Association. He earned his Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree in 2020. Dr. Kohl trained
          at the Valley Baptist Family Practice Residency in Harlingen, Texas (2020-2023), serving as chief resident
          during his third year. His physician mentors exemplified excellent care for physical and spiritual needs,
          always respecting the choices of patients. Being fluent in Spanish, he enjoyed connecting with
          Spanish-speaking patients in the clinic, hospital, and community outreach near the Texas-Mexico
          border.<br><br>    Dr. Kohl’s closest childhood friend, Kayla, became his wife in 2016. After completing
          medical school in Ohio, they were convinced that Kayla’s home state of Texas would be their new home. They
          love hiking, soccer, game nights, and homeschooling their three active sons. The Kohls enjoy worshiping and
          serving together with their local church.<br><br>    Dr. Kohl is thankful for the opportunity to join Rife
          Pediatric and Family Care, serving alongside like-minded, exceptional, caring doctors! He is grateful for the
          freedom to provide holistic patient-centered care without bureaucratic interference. As a family doctor, Dr.
          Kohl treats patients of all ages with a wide range of conditions; he has particular interest in nutrition,
          supplements, sports medicine, and functional medicine. He acquired a comprehensive mold illness protocol
          through his training with the MC360™️ Precision Mold Master Class. He became a diplomat of the American Board
          of Physician Specialties and member of the Institute of Functional Medicine. He is excited to support his
          patients in reaching new levels of health and vitality!<br><br>Dr. Kohl settled in McAllen, Texas with his
          family 6 hours from Tomball. Though he no longer comes to the clinic, he continues to treat his patients
          holistically with virtual functional medicine.</p>

        <p class="paragraph-4">Nicole Hoff is a Board-Certified Physician Assistant (PA) and a proud graduate of Yale
          University School of Medicine's PA Program (2023). Since August 2017, she has called The North Houston Area of
          Texas, home, where she lives with her family on their mini-farm. Her motto is: "Unapologetically changing the
          way healthcare is done. Your health is in your hands. I am here to help."</p>

        <p class="paragraph-4">Nicole's approach to healthcare is deeply personal and family-focused. "I want to have a
          family-friendly practice as well as a schedule that allows my kids to stop sharing their mom so much," Nicole
          shares. "But I also want to be able to pray for my patients and with my patients. I don't want insurance
          dictating the care I give, and I want to ensure my services are affordable. I believe in prescribing lavender
          oil, vitamin d, and sunshine, just as much as I do metformin, ibuprofen, and antibiotics. I also want to
          empower my patients to make their own healthcare decisions, recognizing that God is the great physician."</p>

        <p class="paragraph-4">Before becoming a PA, Nicole earned a Bachelor of Arts in Maternal and Child Health,
          specializing in lactation. For over 15 years, she empowered families as a midwife assistant, doula, childbirth
          educator, and 10 years as an International Board Certified Lactation Consultant (IBCLC). Her time serving as a
          hospital chaplain ignited a passion for supporting those navigating major life transitions, from welcoming
          their first child to experiencing loss or facing barriers to care. Nicole's dedication to mental health care,
          especially for children and families, is at the core of her mission to provide affordable, accessible
          healthcare. In December 2023, Nicole completed her Doctorate of Medical Science from Shenandoah University.
          Her doctoral project focused on integrating Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) screening into primary care
          as a standard of practice.</p>

        <p class="paragraph-4">Outside of work, Nicole cherishes time with her husband and four children (born in '03,
          '05, '10, '13). Together, they strive to "Know Him and make Him known." Whether in the North Houston area or
          her hometown community in the Rio Grande Valley, Nicole is passionate about making a difference.</p>

        <p class="paragraph-4">At Rife Pediatrics & Family Care, Nicole offers primary care for adults and children of
          all ages, faith-based mental healthcare services, and trauma-informed women's health care.</p>

    <h3>Dr. Avani Gupta</h3>

      <div data-w-id="4c4e765e-bfba-b37d-76ba-f0acf84dca9b" style="opacity:0" class="about-text-container">
        <h5 class="heading-5">BIO</h5>
        <p class="paragraph-4">    Dr. Gupta is a Board Certified Family Physician who values the importance of
          preventive care. She grew up in the Pacific Northwest and knew at an early age that her future path would be
          in medicine. After attending Vassar College with a Bachelors in Biology, she achieved her Masters in
          Pharmacology at Tulane University. From there, she completed her Osteopathic medical training with Honors at
          Western University in Pomona, California. She went on to complete her Family Medicine Residency at the Tufts
          University- Harvard Affiliate program in Boston where she was also selected as the Chief Resident. During
          residency, she took a special interest in disorders of the skin and the musculoskeletal system. After
          residency, Dr Gupta moved to Southern California where she practiced urgent care and family medicine. In 2023,
          Dr Gupta along with her husband and three children made the life-changing move to beautiful north Houston
          which has been a blessing for the whole family.<br></p>
        <p class="paragraph-4">    As an osteopathic physician, Dr. Gupta strongly believes that it is important to
          treat the whole patient and not just their symptoms. Osteopathy is based on a deep understanding of how
          anatomy is related to function, and often OMT (osteopathic manipulative treatment) can help restore this
          imbalance. Dr Gupta provides this type of hands-on treatment when appropriate, including muscle energy,
          myofascial release, tender points, counterstrain, lymphatics, and craniosacral modalities.<br></p>
        <p class="paragraph-4">    Dr Gupta values spending time with each patient in order to best understand their
          needs. She strongly believes in individual autonomy and medical freedom, and a patient's active involvement in
          making their personal medical decisions. Using both traditional medicine and osteopathic approaches, she looks
          forward to helping her patients live their best lives!<br></p>
